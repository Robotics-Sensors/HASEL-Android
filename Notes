Neoprene or EPDM HASEL actuators
Conductive hydrogel for electrodes
For linear actuators, pockets can be designed in parallel, allowing uniform expansion and contraction
Bundling several linear actuators together can simulate the structure of a muscle bundle, offering more strength and control
Sheet actuators for large flat muscles
In sheet-like actuators, channels may intersect, allowing for more complex and multi-directional movements
Stacking multiple layers of HASEL actuators can increase the force output, similar to how muscle fibers work together to increase force
sensing capabilities to monitor strain and pressure within the actuator
Develop algorithms to precisely control the movement of the actuators. This may involve PID control, machine learning techniques, or other advanced control strategies
Insulating Fluid: Non-conductive fluids like silicone oil
Electrodes: conductive hydrogels and mechanical clamping methods to connect the hydrogel electrodes to the power supply wires.
Electrode Integration: Embed the electrodes within the Neoprene or EPDM	
Sealing: Ensure the actuator is sealed to prevent fluid leakage
Insulation Material: Use high-quality dielectric materials like polyimide films (0.5mm) to insulate the actuators. These materials should withstand the high voltages used and resist breakdown
Thickness of Insulation: The insulation layer should be thick enough to prevent electrical arcing. A thickness of at least a few millimeters is recommended, depending on the operating voltage
Heat Dissipation: Integrate heat sinks or conductive pathways to manage the heat generated by the actuators and electronics. This prevents overheating of the actuators and surrounding materials
Thermal Insulation: Use materials like ceramic or specialized thermal insulating polymers around areas that are prone to heating, to protect other components
Surge Protection: Incorporate surge protectors to prevent voltage spikes from reaching and damaging the control electronics
Voltage Regulation: Use voltage regulators to ensure that the voltage levels supplied to the actuators are within safe and controlled limits
    For Linear Actuators:
        Placement: Position the electrodes at the ends or along the sides of the actuator. This creates an electric field along the length of the actuator, causing it to contract or expand.
        Material: Use conductive materials like carbon grease, conductive fabrics, or thin metal films. These materials should be flexible and maintain conductivity under deformation.

    For Sheet-like Actuators:
        Placement: Embed the electrodes in a grid or interdigitated pattern throughout the actuator. This ensures uniform electric field distribution and enables complex movements.
        Material: Flexible conductive polymers or hydrogel electrodes can be used. They need to be stretchable and maintain good electrical contact even when the actuator deforms.
    Electrode Thickness: Keep the electrodes thin (a few hundred micrometers) to maintain the overall flexibility of the actuator.
    Connection Points: Ensure that the electrodes have secure connection points for wiring to the power supply. These points should be reinforced to prevent tearing or detachment under movement.
    Compatibility with Insulation: The electrodes should be compatible with the insulation material to prevent chemical degradation or physical separation.
Encapsulation: Fully encapsulate the actuators in a non-conductive, robust outer layer to prevent accidental contact with the high-voltage parts.
Safety Cut-off: Implement a safety cut-off system that automatically shuts down the power supply if a leak or break in the insulation is detected.
Silicone Rubber Thickness:

    At 10k volts, a minimum of 5mm silicone rubber insulation might not be sufficient. The dielectric strength of silicone rubber is approximately 15-25 kV/mm, but safety margins are crucial.
    A better approach would be to use thicker insulation, possibly in the range of 10-15mm, and to conduct tests to ensure this thickness is adequate for preventing electrical breakdown.
    Arc Flash Barriers: Implement physical barriers made of insulating materials like fiberglass or non-conductive polymers around high-voltage components.
    Arc Suppression Systems: In areas with high risk of electrical arcing, consider using arc suppression systems that can detect and extinguish arcs quickly.
Flexible Connections:

    Use highly flexible, fatigue-resistant cables to connect the actuators to their power sources. Silicone-insulated multi-strand wires are a good choice.
    Implement strain relief mechanisms at the connection points to prevent stress on the wires.
Secure and Robust Connectors:

    Employ connectors that lock in place and are resistant to vibration and movement.
    Consider using custom-designed connectors that are specifically tailored to the actuator's design.
    Flexible Sleeves: Use flexible sleeves at the points where wires exit the actuator. These sleeves can be made from materials like silicone or soft plastics that can bend without putting stress on the wire.
    Stress Relief Springs: Implement springs or coiled cables at the connection points. These springs can absorb movement and prevent direct stress on the wire.
    Locking Connectors: Use connectors with a locking mechanism, such as bayonet, screw, or latch locks, which prevent accidental disconnection due to movement or vibration.
    Automotive Grade Connectors: These are designed to withstand harsh conditions, including vibrations, and are a cost-effective option.
Tendons: kevlar cables - Attach tendons to the ends of the actuators. The actuators contract and expand, mimicking muscle movement, and the tendons transmit this force to the skeletal structure. Design the tendon routing to mimic the way human tendons wrap around joints and attach to bones. This ensures natural movement patterns
Ligaments: kevlar cables
Ultra-High Molecular Weight Polyethylene should wrap around all non actuator components
Nylon sheath should wrap around all actuators
Number of Power Supplies: Depending on the size and complexity, the android might require multiple power supplies to distribute the load and reduce wiring complexity.
Include safety features like circuit breakers and voltage regulators
Adjustable Tendon Tension Mechanism:

    Pulley System: Use a pulley system at the attachment points of the tendons to the skeleton. This allows for adjusting the length and tension of the tendons.
    Screw Adjustment: Implement a screw mechanism that can tighten or loosen the tendon. This could be manual or motorized for remote adjustments.
    Tension Sensors: Integrate tension sensors to provide feedback on the tendon tension, allowing for precise control and adjustments.

Actuator Thickness for Biomimetic Muscle Groups:

    Facial Muscles: 2-5mm for finer control.
    Neck Muscles: 5-8mm for balance between flexibility and strength.
    Arm Muscles (Biceps, Triceps): 5-10mm to provide necessary movement without excessive bulk.
    Torso Muscles (Abs, Back): 10-15mm for stronger support and movement.
    Leg Muscles (Thighs, Calves): 10-15mm to support weight and facilitate movement.
    Hand and Foot Muscles: 2-5mm for delicate and precise movements.
    
FPGA Selection:
        Arms: One FPGA for coordinating complex movements of the arms.
        Torso and Neck: One FPGA dedicated to the stability and movement of the torso and neck.
