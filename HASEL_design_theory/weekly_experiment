Day 1: Preparation and Initial Construction
Morning:

Review the design of each muscle's actuator.
Prepare the workspace and gather all necessary materials and tools.
Afternoon:

Begin constructing the actuators. Focus on creating the silicone capsules.
If using hot metal or superglue for sealing, test these methods on a few sample materials to ensure they are effective and do not degrade the silicone.
Day 2: Completion of Actuator Construction
Morning:

Continue building the actuators, focusing on intricate patterns like zigzag or linear pathways.
Afternoon:

Finish constructing all actuators.
Test the seals on each actuator to ensure they are leak-proof.
Day 3: Setup of Manual Pump System
Morning:

Set up the manual pump system. Attach each actuator to its respective pump using tubing.
Integrate the valve system for controlled fluid flow.
Afternoon:

Conduct a preliminary test to check the functionality of each pump and actuator assembly.
Make any necessary adjustments to ensure smooth operation.
Day 4: Initial Testing of Individual Actuators
Morning:

Begin testing individual actuators. Focus on simple muscle groups like the flexor and extensor muscles in the forearm.
Document the range of motion and responsiveness to manual pumping.
Afternoon:

Continue testing with more complex muscle groups, such as the intrinsic muscles of the hand.
Adjust fluid volume and pressure as needed.
Day 5: Integrated Testing of Muscle Groups
Morning:

Test integrated muscle groups, such as the thenar muscles for thumb movements.
Observe and document how individual actuators work in unison.
Afternoon:

Conduct integrated tests for complex hand movements, like grasping or pinching.
Day 6: Analysis and Adjustment
Morning:

Analyze the data collected from the previous days.
Identify any actuators or muscle groups that did not perform as expected.
Afternoon:

Make necessary adjustments to the actuators or the setup based on the analysis.
Retest any adjusted actuators or systems.
Day 7: Final Testing and Documentation
Morning:

Perform final tests on all actuators, both individually and in integrated groups.
Focus on consistency and reliability of the movements.
Afternoon:

Compile all data and observations into a comprehensive report.
Plan next steps based on the outcomes of the manual tests, focusing on transitioning to electrical control systems.
Notes:
Liquid Selection: Use a liquid that won’t degrade the silicone over time. A silicone-based oil or a non-reactive mineral oil could be a good choice.
Documentation: Keep detailed records of each step, including any challenges faced and how they were resolved.
Adjustments: Be prepared to make iterative adjustments to the actuators and the testing setup throughout the week.





heat sealing:

	Materials and Tools:
	
	Plastic Freezer Bags:

	Choose high-quality, durable freezer bags that can withstand some pressure without bursting.
	Ensure they are made of a heat-sealable material (like low-density polyethylene, LDPE).
	Low-Heated Metal Tool:

	A soldering iron with a temperature control or a custom heat sealer can be used.
	The tool must be clean and have a flat edge for even sealing.
	Steps for Creating Sealed Chambers:
	Design the Chamber Layout:

	Plan the shape and size of the chambers within the plastic bag to mimic the actuator patterns (zigzag, linear, etc.).
	Sketch the design on paper as a template.
	Prepare the Sealing Tool:

	Heat the metal tool to a low temperature — just enough to melt the plastic without burning it.
	Test the tool on a scrap piece of the freezer bag to find the optimal temperature and pressure.
	Seal the Bags:

	Place the plastic bag on a flat, heat-resistant surface.
	Use the heated tool to seal the plastic along the lines of your design, applying consistent pressure.
	Allow the plastic to cool and solidify after each seal to ensure a strong bond.
	Test for Leaks:

	After sealing, test the chambers with air or water to check for leaks.
	Apply gentle pressure to ensure the seals hold under the stress of the simulated actuation.
	Connect to the Manual Pump System:

	Fit the tubing and connect each sealed chamber to its manual pump.
	Ensure the connections are airtight.
	Tips for Success:
	Even Pressure: Apply steady, even pressure when sealing to ensure consistent thickness and strength along the seal.
	Avoid Overheating: Overheating the plastic can lead to brittle seals that break easily. Adjust the temperature as needed.
	Safety Precautions: Use heat-resistant gloves and work in a well-ventilated area to avoid fumes from melting plastic.
